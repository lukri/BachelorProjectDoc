This work proves the possibility of creating an AR application for browsers - especially for mobile browsers to be viewed with a Google Cardboard - based on existing JavaScript libraries in a free and accessible way and shows the limitations.
The focus lies on the two libraries \textit{Awe.js} and \textit{Three.js} that are handling the difficult underlying APIs and provides one single user friendly API. 
By simply assembling their provided functions it is possible without tweaking or changing the existing libraries to achieve the goal - however with some limitations for hardware, software and freedman of use.
The work results in different little applications that are created at each step along the way of developing the final actual AR demo.
