\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion }


The project shows, that the implementation of such a program can be done.



Conclusion and Discussion 
Sense of WebGl in a Browser
Limitation of browsers and JavaScript




Better use library, developed by a community, to ensure, that the program evolves together with the browser and its compatibility. Some API could change, like getting better or more restrict access.

Can it be used for further stuff, how does it goes on. Wie gets weiter


there are other solutions too

 
Why to rely on libraries instead of doing on stuff
Eventuell schnell entwickelnde component der thematic ansprechen, pl√∂tzlich ging eine verwendete methode nicht mehr so, wie es gehen sollte. Vermutlich wegen weiterentwicklung vom Browser

other project showed that





Doing a own WebGl libraries shows complexity
My be for Appendix


Limitations and so on
