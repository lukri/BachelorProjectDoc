Further work

add speach regognition to 





alternative to JavaScript -> unity, that would also support scripts in JavaScript
.
requires an adaptation of the "normal" Google Cardboard
there are versions with mirrors (Aryzon Augmented Reality Cardboard) , however I prefer the simple one, with a spare hole for the device camera

three.js vs babylon vs other vs own

(choose library in foresight to cardboard)


enhance google cardboard with straps for arround the head

to have all power a secured web server is needed or localhost what however is cumbersome to just see the demo

browser as tool, wide range but also restictions

The project shows, that the implementation of such a program can be done.



Conclusion and Discussion 
Sense of WebGl in a Browser
Limitation of browsers and JavaScript




Better use library, developed by a community, to ensure, that the program evolves together with the browser and its compatibility. Some API could change, like getting better or more restrict access.

Can it be used for further stuff, how does it goes on. Wie gets weiter


there are other solutions too

 
Why to rely on libraries instead of doing on stuff
Eventuell schnell entwickelnde component der thematic ansprechen, pl√∂tzlich ging eine verwendete methode nicht mehr so, wie es gehen sollte. Vermutlich wegen weiterentwicklung vom Browser

other project showed that





Doing a own WebGl libraries shows complexity
My be for Appendix


Limitations and so on
